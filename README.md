## Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- MongoDB (local installation or MongoDB Atlas)
- npm or yarn

### Backend Setup

1. Navigate to the backend directory:

cd backend
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash

3. Create environment variables:
   - Copy `config.env` and update with your MongoDB URI and JWT secret
   - For local MongoDB: `MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/skillswap`
   - For MongoDB Atlas: Use your connection string

4. Start the server:
```bash
npm start
# or for development
npm run dev
```

The backend will run on `http://localhost:5000`

### Frontend Setup

1. Navigate to the frontend directory:
```bash
cd frontend
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
